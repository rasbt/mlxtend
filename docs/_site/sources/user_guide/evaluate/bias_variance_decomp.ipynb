    "Often, researchers use the terms *bias* and *variance* or \"bias-variance tradeoff\" to describe the performance of a model -- i.e., you may stumble upon talks, books, or articles where people say that a model has a high variance or high bias. So, what does that mean? In general, we might say that \"high variance\" is proportional to overfitting, and \"high bias\" is proportional to underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, why are we attempting to do this bias-variance decomposition in the first place? The decomposition of the loss into bias and variance helps us understand learning algorithms, as these concepts are correlated to underfitting and overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "To use the more formal terms for bias and variance, assume we have a point estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ of some parameter or function $\\theta$. Then, the bias is commonly defined as the difference between the expected value of the estimator and the parameter that we want to estimate:\n",

Similarly, we define the variance as the difference between the expected value of the squared estimator minus the squared expectation of the estimator:\n",

Now, suppose we have different training sets drawn from an unknown distribution defined as \"true function + noise.\" The following plot shows different linear regression models, each fit to a different training set. None of these hypotheses approximate the true function well, except at two points (around x=-10 and x=6). Here, we can say that the bias is large because the difference between the true value and the predicted value, on average (here, average means \"expectation of the training sets\" not \"expectation over examples in the training set\"), is large:\n",

However, if we would consider the expectation over training sets, the average hypothesis would fit the true function perfectly (given that the noise is unbiased and has an expected value of 0). As we can see, the variance is very large, since on average, a prediction differs a lot from the expectation value of the prediction:\n",

    "To get started with the squared error loss decomposition into bias and variance, let use do some algebraic manipulation, i.e., adding and subtracting the expected value of $\\hat{y}$ and then expanding the expression using the quadratic formula $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab)$:\n",

    "Note that decomposing the 0-1 loss into bias and variance components is not as straight-forward as for the squared error loss. To quote Pedro Domingos, a well-known machine learning researcher and professor at University of Washington: \n",

Recall that the 0-1 loss, $L$, is 0 if a class label is predicted correctly, and one otherwise. The main prediction for the squared error loss is simply the average over the predictions $E[\\hat{y}]$ (the expectation is over training sets), for the 0-1 loss Kong & Dietterich and Domingos defined it as the mode. I.e., if a model predicts the label one more than 50% of the time (considering all possible training sets), then the main prediction is 1, and 0 otherwise.\n",

If $y$ is not equal to the main prediction, but $y$ is also is equal to $\\hat{y}$, then $\\hat{y}$ must be equal to the main prediction.

    "\n",
    "Since the bias is 1, the loss is hence defined as \"loss = bias - variance\" if the bias is 1 (or \"loss = 1 - variance\"). This might be quite unintuitive at first, but the explanations Kong, Dietterich, and Domingos offer was that if a model has a very high bias such that it main prediction is always wrong, increasing the variance can be beneficial, since increasing the variance would push the decision boundary, which might lead to some correct predictions just by chance then. In other words, for scenarios with high bias, increasing the variance can improve (decrease) the loss!\n",
