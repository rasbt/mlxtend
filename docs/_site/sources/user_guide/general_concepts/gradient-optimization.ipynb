Due to its stochastic nature, the path towards the global cost minimum is not \"direct\" as in Gradient Descent, but may go \"zig-zag\" if we are visuallizing the cost surface in a 2D space. However, it has been shown that Stochastic Gradient Descent almost surely converges to the global cost minimum if the cost function is convex (or pseudo-convex)[1]."
