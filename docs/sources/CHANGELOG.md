- [Source code (tar.gz)](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/archive/v0.11.0.tar.gz)

##### New Features

-   New function implementing the resampled paired t-test procedure (`paired_ttest_resampled`)
    to compare the performance of two models. ([#323](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/issues/323))
-   New function implementing the k-fold paired t-test procedure (`paired_ttest_kfold_cv`)
    to compare the performance of two models
    (also called k-hold-out paired t-test). ([#324](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/issues/324))
-   New function implementing the 5x2cv paired t-test procedure (`paired_ttest_5x2cv`) proposed by Dieterrich (1998)
    to compare the performance of two models. ([#325](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/issues/325))
- A `refit` parameter was added to stacking classes (similar to the `refit` parameter in the `EnsembleVoteClassifier`), to support classifiers and regressors that follow the scikit-learn API but are not compatible with scikit-learn's `clone` function. ([#322](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/issues/322))
- The `ColumnSelector` now has a `drop_axis` argument to use it in pipelines with `CountVectorizers`. ([#333](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/333))

- Raises an informative error message if `predict` or `predict_meta_features` is called prior to calling the `fit` method in `StackingRegressor` and `StackingCVRegressor`. ([#315](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/issues/315))
- The `plot_decision_regions` function now automatically determines the optimal setting based on the feature dimensions and supports anti-aliasing. The old `res`  parameter has been deprecated. ([#309](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/309) by [Guillaume Poirier-Morency](https://github.com/arteymix))
- Apriori code is faster due to optimization in `onehot transformation` and the amount of candidates generated by the `apriori` algorithm. ([#327](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/327) by [Jakub Smid](https://github.com/jaksmid))
- The `OnehotTransactions` class (which is typically often used in combination with the `apriori` function for association rule mining) is now more memory efficient as it uses boolean arrays instead of integer arrays. In addition, the `OnehotTransactions` class can be now be provided with `sparse` argument to generate sparse representations of the `onehot` matrix to further improve memory efficiency. ([#328](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/328) by [Jakub Smid](https://github.com/jaksmid))
- The `OneHotTransactions` has been deprecated and replaced by the `TransactionEncoder`. ([#332](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/332)
- The `plot_decision_regions` function now has three new parameters, `scatter_kwargs`, `contourf_kwargs`, and `scatter_highlight_kwargs`, that can be used to modify the plotting style. ([#342](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/342) by [James Bourbeau](https://github.com/jrbourbeau))

- Fixed bug that raised an indexing error if the number of items was <= 1 when computing association rules using the conviction metric. ([#340](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/issues/340))

- Allow the `OnehotTransactions` to be cloned via scikit-learn's `clone` function, which is required by e.g., scikit-learn's `FeatureUnion` or `GridSearchCV` (via [Iaroslav Shcherbatyi](https://github.com/iaroslav-ai)). ([#249](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/249))

##### New Features

- Added a `mlxtend.evaluate.bootstrap` that implements the ordinary nonparametric bootstrap to bootstrap a single statistic (for example, the mean. median, R^2 of a regression fit, and so forth) [#232](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/232)
- `SequentialFeatureSelecor`'s `k_features` now accepts a string argument "best" or "parsimonious" for more "automated" feature selection. For instance, if "best" is provided, the feature selector will return the feature subset with the best cross-validation performance. If "parsimonious" is provided as an argument, the smallest feature subset that is within one standard error of the cross-validation performance will be selected. [#238](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/238)

##### Changes

- `SequentialFeatureSelector` now uses `np.nanmean` over normal mean to support scorers that may return `np.nan`  [#211](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/211) (via [mrkaiser](https://github.com/mrkaiser))
- The `skip_if_stuck` parameter was removed from `SequentialFeatureSelector` in favor of a more efficient implementation comparing the conditional inclusion/exclusion results (in the floating versions) to the performances of previously sampled feature sets that were cached [#237](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/237)
- `ExhaustiveFeatureSelector` was modified to consume substantially less memory [#195](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/195) (via [Adam Erickson](https://github.com/adam-erickson))

- Raise meaningful error messages if pandas `DataFrame`s or Python lists of lists are fed into the `StackingCVClassifer` as a `fit` arguments ([198](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/198)).
- The `n_folds` parameter of the `StackingCVClassifier` was changed to `cv` and can now accept any kind of cross validation technique that is available from scikit-learn. For example, `StackingCVClassifier(..., cv=StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3))` or `StackingCVClassifier(..., cv=GroupKFold(n_splits=3))` ([#203](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/pull/203), via [Konstantinos Paliouras](https://github.com/sque)).

- `DenseTransformer` now doesn't raise and error if the input array is *not* sparse
- API clean-up using scikit-learn's `BaseEstimator` as parent class for `feature_selection.ColumnSelector`

##### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a problem when a tuple-range was provided as argument to the `SequentialFeatureSelector`'s `k_features` parameter and the scoring metric was more negative than -1 (e.g., as in scikit-learn's MSE scoring function) (wahutch](https://github.com/wahutch))
- Fixed an `AttributeError` issue when `verbose` > 1 in `StackingClassifier`

- Sequential Feature Selection algorithms were unified into a single `SequentialFeatureSelector` class with parameters to enable floating selection and toggle between forward and backward selection.
- Stratified sampling of MNIST (now 500x random samples from each of the 10 digit categories)
- Renaming `mlxtend.plotting` to `mlxtend.general_plotting` in order to distinguish general plotting function from specialized utility function such as `evaluate.plot_decision_regions`
