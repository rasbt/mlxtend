    "The `make_multiplexer_dataset` function creates a dataset generated by an n-bit Boolean multiplexer. Such dataset represents a dataset generated by a simple rule, based on the behavior of a electric multiplexer, yet presents a relatively challenging classification problem for supervised learning algorithm with interactions between features (epistasis) as it may be encountered in many real-world scenarios [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The following illustration depicts a 6-bit multiplexer that consists of 2 address bits and 4 register bits. The address bits converted to decimal representation point to a position in the register bit. For example, if the address bits are \"00\" (0 in decimal), the address bits point to the register bit at position 0. The value of the register position pointed to determines the class label. For example, if the register bit at position is 0, the class label is 0. Vice versa, if the register bit at position 0 is 1, the class label is 1. \n",

    "In the example above, the address bits \"10\" (2 in decimal) point to the 3rd register position (as we start counting from index 0), which has a bit value of 1. Hence, the class label is 1.\n",

However, if we choose 3 address bits instead, 2^3=8 positions would be covered, resulting in a 11 bit (3 bit + 8 bit = 11 bit) multiplexer, and so forth.\n",
