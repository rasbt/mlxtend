    "K-fold cross-validated paired t-test procedure is a common method for comparing the performance of two models (classifiers or regressors) and addresses some of the drawbacks of the [resampled t-test procedure](paired_ttest_resampled.md); however, this method has still the problem that the training sets overlap and is not recommended to be used in practice [1], and techniques such as the [`paired_ttest_5x2cv`](paired_ttest_5x2cv.md) should be used instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain how this method works, let's consider to estimator (e.g., classifiers) A and B. Further, we have a labeled dataset *D*. In the common hold-out method, we typically split the dataset into 2 parts: a training and a test set. In the k-fold cross-validated paired t-test procedure, we split the test set into *k* parts of equal size, and each of these parts is then used for testing while the remaining *k-1* parts (joined together) are used for training a classifier or regressor (i.e., the standard k-fold cross-validation procedure).\n",
    "\n",
    "In each k-fold cross-validation iteration, we then compute the difference in performance between A and B in each so that we obtain *k* difference measures. Now, by making the assumption that these *k* differences were independently drawn and follow an approximately normal distribution, we can compute the following *t* statistic with *k-1* degrees of freedom according to Student's *t* test, under the null hypothesis that the models A and B have equal performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{\\overline{p} \\sqrt{k}}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k}(p^{(i) - \\overline{p}})^2 / (k-1)}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $p^{(i)}$ computes the difference between the model performances in the $i$th iteration, $p^{(i)} = p^{(i)}_A - p^{(i)}_B$, and $\\overline{p}$ represents the average difference between the classifier performances, $\\overline{p} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum^k_{i=1} p^{(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we computed the *t* statistic we can compute the p value and compare it to our chosen significance level, e.g., $\\alpha=0.05$. If the p value is smaller than $\\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis and accept that there is a significant difference in the two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this method, and the reason why it is not recommended to be used in practice, is that it violates an assumption of Student's *t* test [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the difference between the model performances ($p^{(i)} = p^{(i)}_A - p^{(i)}_B$) are not normal distributed because $p^{(i)}_A$ and $p^{(i)}_B$ are not independent\n",
    "- the $p^{(i)}$'s themselves are not independent because training sets overlap"
