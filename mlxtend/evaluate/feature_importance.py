    """Feature importance imputation via permutation importance

    Parameters
    ----------

    X : NumPy array, shape = [n_samples, n_features]
        Dataset, where n_samples is the number of samples and
        n_features is the number of features.

    y : NumPy array, shape = [n_samples]
        Target values.

    predict_method : prediction function
        A callable function that predicts the target values
        from X.

    metric : str, callable
        The metric for evaluating the feature importance through
        permutation. By default, the strings 'accuracy' is
        recommended for classifiers and the string 'r2' is
        recommended for regressors. Optionally, a custom
        scoring function (e.g., `metric=scoring_func`) that
        accepts two arguments, y_true and y_pred, which have
        similar shape to the `y` array.

    num_rounds : int (default=1)
        Number of rounds the feature columns are permuted to
        compute the permutation importance.

    seed : int or None (default=None)
        Random seed for permuting the feature columns.

    Returns
    ---------

    mean_importance_vals, all_importance_vals : NumPy arrays.
      The first array, mean_importance_vals has shape [n_features, ] and
      contains the importance values for all features.
      The shape of the second array is [n_features, num_rounds] and contains
      the feature importance for each repetition. If num_rounds=1,
      it contains the same values as the first array, mean_importance_vals.

    Examples
    -----------
