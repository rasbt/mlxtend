class ExhaustiveFeatureSelector(BaseEstimator, MetaEstimatorMixin):

    """Exhaustive Feature Selection for Classification and Regression.
       (new in v0.4.3)

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : scikit-learn classifier or regressor
    min_features : int (default: 1)
        Minumum number of features to select
    max_features : int (default: 1)
        Maximum number of features to select
    print_progress : bool (default: True)
        Prints progress as the number of epochs
        to stderr.
    scoring : str, (default='accuracy')
        Scoring metric in {accuracy, f1, precision, recall, roc_auc}
        for classifiers,
        {'mean_absolute_error', 'mean_squared_error',
        'median_absolute_error', 'r2'} for regressors,
        or a callable object or function with
        signature ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.
    cv : int (default: 5)
        Scikit-learn cross-validation generator or `int`.
        If estimator is a classifier (or y consists of integer class labels),
        stratified k-fold is performed, and regular k-fold cross-validation
        otherwise.
        No cross-validation if cv is None, False, or 0.
    n_jobs : int (default: 1)
        The number of CPUs to use for evaluating different feature subsets
        in parallel. -1 means 'all CPUs'.
    pre_dispatch : int, or string (default: '2*n_jobs')
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched
        during parallel execution if `n_jobs > 1` or `n_jobs=-1`.
        Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an explosion of
        memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched than CPUs can process.
        This parameter can be:
        None, in which case all the jobs are immediately created and spawned.
            Use this for lightweight and fast-running jobs,
            to avoid delays due to on-demand spawning of the jobs
        An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are spawned
        A string, giving an expression as a function
            of n_jobs, as in `2*n_jobs`
    clone_estimator : bool (default: True)
        Clones estimator if True; works with the original estimator instance
        if False. Set to False if the estimator doesn't
        implement scikit-learn's set_params and get_params methods.
        In addition, it is required to set cv=0, and n_jobs=1.

    Attributes
    ----------
    best_idx_ : array-like, shape = [n_predictions]
        Feature Indices of the selected feature subsets.
    best_feature_names_ : array-like, shape = [n_predictions]
        Feature names of the selected feature subsets. If pandas
        DataFrames are used in the `fit` method, the feature
        names correspond to the column names. Otherwise, the
        feature names are string representation of the feature
        array indices. New in v 0.13.0.
    best_score_ : float
        Cross validation average score of the selected subset.
    subsets_ : dict
        A dictionary of selected feature subsets during the
        exhaustive selection, where the dictionary keys are
        the lengths k of these feature subsets. The dictionary
        values are dictionaries themselves with the following
        keys: 'feature_idx' (tuple of indices of the feature subset)
              'feature_names' (tuple of feature names of the feat. subset)
              'cv_scores' (list individual cross-validation scores)
              'avg_score' (average cross-validation score)
        Note that if pandas
        DataFrames are used in the `fit` method, the 'feature_names'
        correspond to the column names. Otherwise, the
        feature names are string representation of the feature
        array indices. The 'feature_names' is new in v 0.13.0.
