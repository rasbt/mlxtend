    """Feature Selection for Classification and Regression.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator: scikit-learn classifier or regressor
    strategy: Strategy
        Description of search strategy: a named tuple
        with fields `initial_state`, 
        `candidate_states`, `build_submodel`, 
        `check_finished` and `postprocess`.

    verbose: int (default: 0), level of verbosity to use in logging.
        If 0, no output,
        if 1 number of features in current set, if 2 detailed logging 
        including timestamp and cv scores at step.
    scoring: str, callable, or None (default: None)
        If None (default), uses 'accuracy' for sklearn classifiers
        and 'r2' for sklearn regressors.
        If str, uses a sklearn scoring metric string identifier, for example
        {accuracy, f1, precision, recall, roc_auc} for classifiers,
        {'mean_absolute_error', 'mean_squared_error'/'neg_mean_squared_error',
        'median_absolute_error', 'r2'} for regressors.
        If a callable object or function is provided, it has to be conform with
        sklearn's signature ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``; see
        http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html
        for more information.
    cv: int (default: 5)
        Integer or iterable yielding train, test splits. If cv is an integer
        and `estimator` is a classifier (or y consists of integer class
        labels) stratified k-fold. Otherwise regular k-fold cross-validation
        is performed. No cross-validation if cv is None, False, or 0.
    n_jobs: int (default: 1)
        The number of CPUs to use for evaluating different feature subsets
        in parallel. -1 means 'all CPUs'.
    pre_dispatch: int, or string (default: '2*n_jobs')
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched
        during parallel execution if `n_jobs > 1` or `n_jobs=-1`.
        Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an explosion of
        memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched than CPUs can process.
        This parameter can be:
        None, in which case all the jobs are immediately created and spawned.
            Use this for lightweight and fast-running jobs,
            to avoid delays due to on-demand spawning of the jobs
        An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are spawned
        A string, giving an expression as a function
            of n_jobs, as in `2*n_jobs`
    clone_estimator: bool (default: True)
        Clones estimator if True; works with the original estimator instance
        if False. Set to False if the estimator doesn't
        implement scikit-learn's set_params and get_params methods.
        In addition, it is required to set cv=0, and n_jobs=1.

    Attributes
    ----------
    results_: dict
        A dictionary of selected feature subsets during the
        selection, where the dictionary keys are
        the states of these feature selector. The dictionary
        values are dictionaries themselves with the following
        keys: 'scores' (list individual cross-validation scores)
              'avg_score' (average cross-validation score)

    Notes
    -----

    See `Strategy` for explanation of the fields.
