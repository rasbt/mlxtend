    "Sequential feature selection algorithms are a family of greedy search algorithms that are used to reduce an initial *d*-dimensional feature space to a *k*-dimensional feature subspace where *k < d*. The motivation behind feature selection algorithms is to automatically select a subset of features most relevant to the problem. The goal of feature selection is two-fold: We want to improve the computational efficiency and reduce the model's generalization error by removing irrelevant features or noise. In addition, a wrapper approach such as sequential feature selection is advantageous if embedded feature selection -- for example, a regularization penalty like LASSO -- is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, SFAs remove or add one feature at a time based on the classifier performance until a feature subset of the desired size *k* is reached. There are four different flavors of SFAs available via the `SequentialFeatureSelector`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sequential Forward Selection (SFS)\n",
    "2. Sequential Backward Selection (SBS)\n",
    "3. Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS)\n",
    "4. Sequential Backward Floating Selection (SBFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***floating*** variants, SFFS and SBFS, can be considered extensions to the simpler SFS and SBS algorithms. The floating algorithms have an additional exclusion or inclusion step to remove features once they were included (or excluded) so that a larger number of feature subset combinations can be sampled. It is important to emphasize that this step is conditional and only occurs if the resulting feature subset is assessed as \"better\" by the criterion function after the removal (or addition) of a particular feature. Furthermore, I added an optional check to skip the conditional exclusion steps if the algorithm gets stuck in cycles.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this different from *Recursive Feature Elimination* (RFE)  -- e.g., as implemented in `sklearn.feature_selection.RFE`? RFE is computationally less complex using the feature weight coefficients (e.g., linear models) or feature importance (tree-based algorithms) to eliminate features recursively, whereas SFSs eliminate (or add) features based on a user-defined classifier/regression performance metric.\n",

      "    (2) Although two or more individual features may be considered as one group\n",
      "    throughout the feature-selection process, it does not mean the individual\n",
      "    features of that group have the same impact on the outcome. For instance, in\n",
      "    linear regression, the coefficient of the feature 2 and 3 can be different\n",
      "    even if they are considered as one group in feature_groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "    (3) If both fixed_features and feature_groups are specified, ensure that each\n",
      "    feature group contains the fixed_features selection. E.g., for a 3-feature set\n",
