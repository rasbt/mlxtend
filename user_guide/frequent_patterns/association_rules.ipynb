    "Rule generation is a common task in the mining of frequent patterns. _An association rule is an implication expression of the form $X \\rightarrow Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are disjoint itemsets_ [1]. A more concrete example based on consumer behaviour would be  $\\{Diapers\\} \\rightarrow \\{Beer\\}$ suggesting that people who buy diapers are also likely to buy beer. To evaluate the \"interest\" of such an association rule, different metrics have been developed. The current implementation make use of the `confidence` and `lift` metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The currently supported metrics for evaluating association rules and setting selection thresholds are listed below. Given a rule \"A -> C\", *A* stands for antecedant and *C* stands for consequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 'support':\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{support}(A\\rightarrow C) = \\text{support}(A \\cup C), \\;\\;\\; \\text{range: } [0, 1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- introduced in [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The support metric is defined for itemsets, not assocication rules. The table produced by the association rule mining algorithm contains three different support metrics: 'antecedant support', 'consequent support', and 'support'. Here, 'antecedant support' computes the proportion of transactions that contain the antecedant A, and 'consequent support' computes the support for the itemset of the consequent C. The 'support' metric then computes the support of the combined itemset A $\\cup$ C -- note that 'support' depends on 'antecedant support' and 'consequent support' via min('antecedant support', 'consequent support').\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, support is used to measure the abundance or frequency (often interpreted as significance or importance) of an itemset in a database. We refer to an itemset as a \"frequent itemset\" if you support is larger than a specified minimum-support threshold. Note that in general, due to the *downward closure* property, all subsets of a frequent itemset are also frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 'confidence':  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{confidence}(A\\rightarrow C) = \\frac{\\text{support}(A\\rightarrow C)}{\\text{support}(A)}, \\;\\;\\; \\text{range: } [0, 1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- introduced in [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence of a rule A->C is the probability of seeing the consequent in a transaction given that it also contains the antecedent. Note that the metric is not symmetric or directed; for instance, the confidence for A->C is different than the confidence for C->A. The confidence is 1 (maximal) for a rule A->C if the consequent and antecedent always occur together. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 'lift':\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{lift}(A\\rightarrow C) = \\frac{\\text{confidence}(A\\rightarrow C)}{\\text{support}(C)}, \\;\\;\\; \\text{range: } [0, \\infty]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- introduced in [4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The lift metric is commonly used to measure how much more often the antecedent and consequent of a rule A->C occur together than we would expect if they were statistically independent. If A and C are independent, the Lift score will be exactly 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 'leverage':\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{levarage}(A\\rightarrow C) = \\text{support}(A\\rightarrow C) - \\text{support}(A) \\times \\text{support}(C), \\;\\;\\; \\text{range: } [-1, 1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- introduced in [5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Leverage computes the difference between the observed frequency of A and C appearing together and the frequency that would be expected if A and C were independent. An leverage value of 0 indicates independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 'conviction':\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{conviction}(A\\rightarrow C) = \\frac{1 - \\text{support}(C)}{1 - \\text{confidence}(A\\rightarrow C)}, \\;\\;\\; \\text{range: } [0, \\infty]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- introduced in [6]\n",
    "\n",
    "A high conviction value means that the consequent is highly depending on the antecedent. For instance, in the case of a perfect confidence score, the denominator becomes 0 (due to 1 - 1) for which the conviction score is defined as 'inf'. Similar to lift, if items are independent, the conviction is 1.\n",
